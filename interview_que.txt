Que1.What are the datatypes available in Python ?
Following are the in-built datatypes in Python programming :

Ans => Boolean
      Numeric
      int
      float
      long
      complex
      String
      List
      Tuple
      Set
      Dictionary


Que2.What are the mutable builtin datatypes available ?
Mutable datatype are those

Ans => List
     Sets
     Dictionaries


Que3.What are the immutable builtin datatypes available ?
Immutable datatypes are those

Ans=>Strings
    Tuples
    Numbers


Que4. What immutable mean and what three types of python core data types are considered immutable?

Ans=> An immutable data type is a type of object which cannot be modified after its creation. Numbers, strings, and tuples are immutable in python>


Que5. what are tuples?

Ans=> Tuples are the sequence data type with immutable values in python. Tuples are used to store multiple items in single variable.


Que6. Differentiate between list and tuple?

Ans => List
.List are mutable data type
.List consume more memory
.The list is better for performing operations,such as insertion and deletion
.Impliction of iteration is time consuming

  Tuples
.Tuples are immutable data type
.Tuples consume less memory as compared to list
.Tuple data type is appropriate for accessing the elements
.Impliction of iteration is comparatively faster.


Que7. What is for loop in python?

Ans => A for loop in python requires at least two variables to work. The first is the iterable object such as a list,tuple or a string.And second is the variable
      to store the successive vakues from the sequence in the loop.


Que8. How to use a break statement in python for loops?

Ans => An break statement can be used to terminate a loop. It is often used when the programmer needs to stop iterating through the data and
 instead go back to checking for other condition.

code example for break statement:
animals = ["dog","cat","sheep","tiger"]
for i in animals:
   print(x)
if i == "tiger":
   break


Que9. What is the difference between a for loop and a while loop?

Ans => A for loop is typically used when you know exactly how many times the loop needss to be repeated. A while loop is typically used when you
     don't know how many times the loop needs to be repeated.
     A while loop repeats as long as its condition is true. For example, if a while loop says "while x == 5",
     then the line will execute as long as x equals five.


Que10. What is the use of self in python?

Ans => Self is used to represent the instance of the class. With this keyword, you can access the attributes and methods of the class in python.
     It binds the attributes with the given arguments. self is used in different places and often thought to be a keyword. 
 

Que11. What is the syntax for Python If statement ?

Ans => Python If statement contains if keyword, condition followed by colon symbol (:), and then the statements of if block with indentation.

if condition:
    statement1
    statement2
    statementN
Condition should evaluate to a boolean value (true or false).


Que12. What is Elif programming?
Ans => The elif keyword is used in conditional statements (if statements), and is short for else if.


Que13. How do you call a function in if condition Python?
Ans => To call a function, you have to write the function name followed by parenthesis containing the parameters you want to pass to the method


Que14. What are the 3 types of Python conditional statements?
Ans => Python provides four conditional statements.In Python we can achieve decision making by using the following statements:

if statements.
if-else statements.
elif statements.
Nested if and if-else statements.
elif ladder.


Que15. What == means in Python?
Ans => The == operator compares the value or equality of two objects, whereas the Python is operator checks whether two variables point to the same object in memory. 
       In the vast majority of cases, this means you should use the equality operators == and !=


Que16. Write a program to check whether a number is divisible by 7 or not.
Ans => num = int(input("Enter your age"))
       if num % 7 == 0 :
         print("number is divisible")
       else:
          print("number is not divisible")


Que17. What is boolean in python?
Ans => Boolean is one of the built- in data type in python, it mainly contains two values, and they are true or false.
       In python bool() is the method used to convert a value toa boolean value.


Que18. What are the different types of operators in python?
Ans => In python there are variety of operators they are as follows:

      Arithmetic operator
      Assignment operator
      Logical operator
      Membership operator
      Identity operator
      Bitwise operator


Que19. What happens when a function doesn't have a return statement? Is it valid in python?
Ans => yes, it is valid. The function will then return a None object.


Que20. What is the difference between remove() function and del() function?
Ans => The user can remove() function to delete a specific object in the list.
